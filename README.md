I have created a website which I will regularly update. The main purpose of this website is to try and test new things into it to make it look more beautiful. Feedback are welcome, as I am still a beginner, and I would love to be able to make it look better. 

You are welcome to introduce even very basic changes to it which could be as small as solving some typos in the README.md or improving its content. You can also create new issues and start working on it. It would be beneficial for someone who is not yet introduced to using git and GitHub. If you have solved some issues earlier try to leave it for someone who is entirely a beginner. Thanks!

Instructions:

1. Fork this repository.

2. Make some good changes to it.

3. Then make a direct pull request with adding a screenshot of new changes.
